Introduction 

The Hit and Run Strategy is a structured approach to trading in the Over/Under market on Deriv. This strategy 

leverages statistical analysis of digit occurrences to determine high-probability entry points.  

The goal is to execute trades quickly based on specific conditions, ensuring minimal exposure while maximizing 

accuracy. 

Strategy Overview 

The strategy focuses on two key trade types: 

1. Trading Over 1 

2. Trading Under 8 

Each trade type has well-defined conditions based on digit occurrence probabilities, trend confirmation, and a 

validation process using a 3-tick sequence (tick synchronization). 

Prediction: Over 1 

Entry Digits: 5 or 9 

Validation: If either digit appears, check the next 3-tick sequence to determine if it would be a win. 

Execution: If the 3-tick sequence confirms a win, pick the number as your entry and wait for the next trading 

confirmation before executing the trade. 

Conditions: 

1. Follow the Trend: - Ensure the market is in an uptrend. - Look for green (bullish) candlesticks that are increasing in size, indicating strong buying 

momentum. 

2. Digit Occurrence Filter: - Digits 0 and 1 must have a percentage occurrence rate of less than 10% before entering the trade. 

Prediction: Under 8 

Entry Digits: 0, 4, or 9 

Validation: If any of these digits appear, check the next 3-tick sequence to determine if it would be a win. 

Execution: If the 3-tick sequence confirms a win, pick the number as your entry and wait for the next trading 

signal before executing the trade. 

Conditions: 

1. Follow the Trend: - Ensure the market is in a downtrend. - Look for red (bearish) candlesticks that are increasing in size, indicating strong selling momentum. 

2. Digit Occurrence Filter: - Digits 9 and 8 must have a percentage occurrence rate of less than 10% before entering the trade. 

Trading Rule: Hit and Run, Increase Stake - Execute the trade as per the validated entry criteria. 

- Once a trade is executed and won, exit the market and wait for the next valid confirmation. - Increase the stake progressively to maximize profitability while maintaining risk control. 

Risk Management - Stake Allocation: Use a controlled staking plan to prevent excessive losses. - Max Consecutive Trades: Limit to 3 trades per interval to minimize risk. - Stop Loss: Set a predefined stop loss to preserve capital. - Take Profit: Exit once a target profit threshold is reached. 

Conclusion 

The Hit and Run Strategy is designed for traders looking for quick and precise entries in Deriv's Over/Under 

market.  

By following the digit occurrence criteria, validating entries using a 3-tick sequence, and executing trades based 

on data-driven signals, traders can enhance their success rate while maintaining discipline and risk control.  

The key rule is to hit and run while increasing stake strategically to optimize returns.`;
